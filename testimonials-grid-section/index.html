                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I

                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                    their experiences was easy.</h1>

                    <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my
                        progress which I find really refreshing. The
                        program gave me the confidence necessary to be
                        able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                        capable junior developer. The standard is above the
                        rest. You will get the personal attention you need

                <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a
                    line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                    very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                    assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                    level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                    fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
